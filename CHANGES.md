Changes! 
Figured out how to get teting to work, and modified files to get that up and running


Modified the AACMAppings class to get it to have its own AACCattegory keeping track of the link between images and their file names for each directory alongsid the "Mappings" class which keeps trac the filename and the actual AACCategory for each one.

Further debugging of little nitty gritty functions, such as skipping lines with impropper formating.
